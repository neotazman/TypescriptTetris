# This is a tetris game that I'm building as my first typescript project

# the width and height of the gamepieces will reflect each specific piece

# trying to add the gamestate as a parameter for the gamepiece class, still need to adjust it
    a) put the gamestate parameter on each of the subclasses
    b) the rest of the subclass is the argument for the superclass

# findIndex takes an optional second argument of which index to start with. 
    a) make a function indices(previousIndex?) run the findIndex function within indices
    b) add the return 
    c) within the findIndex callback function, if it would return true, add the value to an array and run indices with the value of the previous return value to add to the value array
